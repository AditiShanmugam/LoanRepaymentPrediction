# LoanRepaymentPrediction
This is an implementation of Decision Trees and Random Forest to predict repayment of loans. Both the models were trained on a public dataset available on LendingClub.com. The dataset contains information about loans borrowed in the year 2016 and their repayment status. 

A Decision tree is a prediction algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to predict outcomes based on the data features. A Random forest is an ensamble of Decision Trees. It makes a prediction using outputs by combining outputs from individual Decision Trees. 

Here you will see a comparision of the Accuracy scores of both the models.
